# NACtranslate

Translation for Live Church Services

## Overview

NACtranslate is designed to facilitate real-time translation for live church services by leveraging two open source projects:
- **Vosk** for speech-to-text transcription
- **Argos** for text-to-text translation

This project prioritizes privacy by keeping all user interactions on your private network. It avoids using external APIs to ensure that client data remains strictly confidentialâ€”a key consideration for environments such as churches, accounting, healthcare, and legal services.
